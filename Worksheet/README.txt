This program creates a worksheet of random "number bond" problems.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_bond

The idea comes from the Singapore Math curriculum that my kids are following.

It outputs an HTML file with 48 randomly generated problems on it. This fits nicely on one page when I print it from Chrome. YMMV.

TODO:

 * Other worksheet types
 * PDF output?
